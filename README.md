# The ICEYE Data Scout Assignment

This is the assignment for the Data Scout Position described [here](https://apply.workable.com/iceye/j/67C0484605/)

We expect the task to take something like 2-4 hours. Try to follow that time limit.

## Requirements

We expect your assignment to include 

* The resulting data from the task in JSON format. (or more like an array of JSON objects)
* Python code/script that retrived the data and produced the JSON file
* Written text (.md, .txt or .docx) that explains how you would automate this code and how/where you would store the data it gathers. If you plan to include cloud services in your answer, you can use AWS services as an example

You can send these in a zip file or provide a Github Repository to the email address you are provided with.

And also, have fun!

## The Task

Write a script to retrive the latest measurements of all Taiwanese water level gauges. The source of this information can be found here https://fhy.wra.gov.tw/fhy/Monitor/Water

Save all information on the html table and produce an array of JSON objects where one object represents one water level station and the information related to it in one point in time. 

## Extra task if you still have time

Scout the internet and attach the Taiwanese water level station locations to the measurements. Can be a static file or code how to retrieve them.
