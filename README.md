# The ICEYE Data Scout Assignment

This is the assignment for the Data Scout Position described [here](https://apply.workable.com/iceye/j/67C0484605/)

We expect the task to take something like 2-4 hours. Try to follow that time limit.

## Requirements

We expect your solution to include 

* The resulting data from the task in JSON format
* Python script that retrived the data and produced the JSON file
* Written text that explains how you would automate this code and where you would store the data it gathers. If you plan to include cloud services in your answer, you can use AWS services as an example

You can send these in a zip file or provide a Github Repository including these files to the email address you are provided with.

And also, have fun hacking!
